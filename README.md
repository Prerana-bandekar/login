Problem statement:
Create a login page that allows only registered users to login. 
If the User is not registered then the login fails.

Implementation:
The Model View Controller design pattern separates concerns into model, view and controller. 
The model contains data, view has the UI logic and controller has the backend code for application logic.
We can separate the business logic from presentation logic. We can create a desktop application using swing.
The model is connected to the login database where all the registered userdata is stored and checked in the controller part when the user tried to login.
